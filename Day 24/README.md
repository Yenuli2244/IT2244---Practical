# ðŸ§µ Multi-threading in C â€“ Program Collection
This project includes 5 simple C programs that demonstrate the use of POSIX threads (pthread) for various multi-threading operations.

## ðŸ“˜ Program Descriptions
### âœ… Q1: Basic Thread Creation and Join
**File: ```Q1.c```**

Creates two threads. Each thread prints a message that it is running. The main thread waits for both threads to finish.

### âœ… Q2: Print Thread IDs of 5 Threads
**File: ```Q2.c```**

Creates 5 threads. Each thread prints its unique thread ID and then exits. The main thread joins all and prints a final message.

### âœ… Q3: Thread Printing 1 to 10 with Delay
**File: ```Q3.c```**

Creates one thread which prints numbers from 1 to 10, with a delay of 1 second between prints. Main thread waits for it to complete.

### âœ… Q4: Shared Counter with Increment and Decrement Threads
**File: ```Q4.c```**

- One thread increments a global counter 100 times.
- Another thread decrements the same counter 100 times.
- Mutex lock is used to avoid race conditions.

### âœ… Q5: Square Calculation Using Thread Return Value
**File: ```Q5.c```**

A thread is created to square a number. It returns the result using ```pthread_exit```, and the main thread collects it via ```pthread_join```.
