# ðŸ“Œ Fork-Based Number Printing and Summation
## Description
This C program demonstrates the use of the ```fork()``` system call to create a child process. It performs the following tasks:
- The ```child process``` prints numbers from ```1 to 5``` and calculates their sum.
- The ```parent process``` prints numbers from ```6 to 10``` and calculates their sum.
- The parent then calculates and prints the ```total sum (1 to 10)```.
