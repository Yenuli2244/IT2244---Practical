###############if else 
if(condition){
  //body of if statment;
}
else{
  //body of else statment;
}
Example: Enter your age and verify your aligible or not for election voting 
using if else condition .


#########Ternary operator
test_condition ? expression1 : expression2;

####switch operator
switch(variable/expression){
   case 1:
     //body of case 1
     break;
   case 2:
     //body of case 2
     break;

   case n:
     //body of case n
     break;

  default:

   }
Example 1: Enter the value between 1 to 7 and create a program for following output:
Enter the number between 1 to 7 : 1
Today is Sunday!

Example 2:
write a code for small astrology based on your life path number for that  get date of birth 
from user then calculate life path number.(use switch case)
output:
     case 1-Date: 23
	 case 2-Date: 29

     calculation for life path number:                    
			  a=date%10     3                                
			  b=date/10     2
			  c=a+b         5
	  if life path number :
			  1:Lucky
			  2:Carefuly do your work
			  3:Storger
			  4:Happy
			  5:Can get help
			  6:Doubt
			  7:Sad 
			  8:Like
			  9:Courage

Example 3:
Give list of numbers then calculate the summation and multiplication using for loop.
 Example:-
    1 2 3 4 5                             
	summation = 15                         
    multiplication =120
	
Example 4:
Print the integers from 1  to 10 using while loop.

EXAMPLE 5:
Write a C program to generate and print the Fibonacci series up to a specified 
number of terms. The program should take the number of terms as input from the 
user and then display the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.

EXAMPLE 6:
Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

Example 7:
Write a C program that:
Accepts two strings as input from the user.
Concatenates the two strings Displays the concatenated result.

Example 8:
Write a C program that takes a binary number (as an integer) as input and 
converts it to its decimal equivalent.

Example 9:
Write a C program that:
Accepts an array of integers from the user.
Finds and displays the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Example 10:
C program to generate Pascal's Triangle.

Output:
no of rows =5
          1
        1   1
      1   2   1
    1   3   3   1
  1   4   6   4   1
